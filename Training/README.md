After finishing the courses above, there is the following exercise:
# Exercise - Corona Dashboard
In this exercise we will create a dashboard showing information regarding COVID-19 around in the world.
1. Create an Angular project.
2. Use https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data to get different types of information, like total cases, cases per country, recovered etc.
3. The dashboard should have the following features:
3.1. The amount of total cases in the world, displayed and updated automatically.
3.2. Requesting latest information about a specific country, and adding this country to a list of countries, for which one can see the full COVID-19 information: confirmed, critical, deaths, recovered.
3.3. For each specific country, create a display the above values in a graph, showing the country's values in the last 90 days (should be configurable).
4. The whole project must be managed with git locally, and in GITHUB for a remote server. The code should be seperated to different feature branches, and merged back into the main branch using pull-requests, with a more experianced developer as code-reviewer.

GoodLuck!
