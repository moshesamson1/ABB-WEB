# Training 
The training will be going over a full course of Angular. There are 2 options for that:
1. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/want-to-learn-angular-heres-our-free-33-part-course-by-dan-wahlin-fc2ff27ab451/ - this is a free 33-parts Angular course, covering the fundementals of angular.
2. https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/angular - in plulalsight, there is a full path designated to angular. this options cost money, and therefore we cannot force you to do it, but it is highly recommended to go through the courses in this path.

It is required to finish at least one of those options above before doing the final excercise. Mind you that the second options is way more thorough, so if this is the option you choose, consult the team leader as to when to do the final excercise.
